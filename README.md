2. Make sure you have *npm* and *git* installed

If you cloned the repository with git, make sure you `git reset --hard vX.Y` to a specific version, as latest master isn't always production ready!

I am available for contact via my [support Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/SSkbwSJ). I will always do my best to respond, however I am often busy so can't always be available right away, and as this is a free service I may not always be able to resolve your query.
